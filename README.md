# Global Land Temperature Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Climate Change Patterns 🌡️🌍

## Overview
This project analyzes global surface temperature data to understand climate change patterns, predict future temperature trends, and visualize temperature variations across different countries. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, time series visualization, and future temperature predictions using machine learning.

## Features
- 📊 Global temperature trend analysis
- 🗺️ Country-wise temperature comparison
- 📈 Linear regression for temperature prediction
- 🔄 Interactive visualizations using Plotly
- 🧹 Comprehensive data cleaning methods
- 📉 Statistical analysis and insights

## Requirements
```python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
plotly
```

## Installation
You can run this project directly in Google Colab or install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
```

## Dataset
The project uses the "GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv" dataset, which contains historical temperature records for various countries. The dataset includes:
- Date
- Average Temperature
- Average Temperature Uncertainty
- Country

## Key Visualizations
1. Global Average Temperature Over Time
2. Top 10 Countries with Highest Temperature Increase
3. Interactive World Map of Average Temperatures
4. Temperature Prediction Model Results
